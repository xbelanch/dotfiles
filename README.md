# dotfiles

Bunch of configuration files. Can be installed by running the following commands (require [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/xbelanch/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```

Restart the terminal to source the new config files.
